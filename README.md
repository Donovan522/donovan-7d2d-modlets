# Donovan's 7 Days to Die Modlets

The goal is to create a _less grindy_ experience in 7 Days to Die, so you can enjoy the other aspects of the game. As such, these mods only make changes to things like resource stack sizes and gathering, resource requirements, and experience requirements. Nothing has been changed to make the game "easier" in other ways.

## The Modlets

These are all intended to work in unison, so feel free to mix and match to suit your needs, however, pay attention to any conflicts listed in the descriptions.

## History

I previously used an excellent XML config replacement made by SpikeDaddy, which he still maintains, so full credit to his work for my inspiration!

With the addition of xpath modlets support in the latest versions of 7D2D (and in the [7D2DLauncher utility](http://7d2dmodlauncher.org/7D2DModLauncher.html)), I decided to convert some of his changes along with some of my own into a series of modlets. The result is this body of work, which will be updated with new ideas and to support future stable versions of 7D2D.

Enjoy!
